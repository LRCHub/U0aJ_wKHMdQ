Inertia
I've worn the same skinny jeans
Since I was fifteen
It's probably nothing
Inertia
My friends say
they're quitting this week
To chase down their dreams
They're probably bluffing
But
Don't you like it bigger,
better, but you do what you can?
Do what you can
Don't you like a little better
when you don't understand?
Don't understand
I was gonna save the planet,
but today I got plans
I guess this is just what I am
I'm an object in motion
I've lost all emotion
My two legs are broken,
but look at me dance
An object in motion,
don't ask where I'm going
'Cause where I am going is right
where I am
Oh man!
Where I am going is right
where I am
Inertia
You'd said you'd break up
with her
But she met your family,
and dating's the worst
Yeah
Inertia
Now you're not in love anymore
But you'll stick it out for like
twenty years more
Saying, oh
Don't you like it bigger,
better, but you do what you can?
Do what you can
Don't you like a little better
when you don't understand?
Don't understand
I was gonna save the planet,
but today I got plans
I guess this is just what I am
I'm an object in motion
I've lost all emotion
My two legs are broken,
but look at me dance
An object in motion,
don't ask where I'm going
'Cause where I am going is right
where I am
Oh man!
Where I am going is right
where I am
Oh man!
Where I am going is right
where I am
Inertia
I wanna move out of this town
But everyone knows me,
and packing is tiring
Inertia
I said I would start working out
But I'm fucking hungry,
and screw you, I'm trying
Inertia
I wanna be big like my plans,
so why'm I so tiny
And why'm I so mad?
It's inertia
Guess this is just what I am
I'm stuck in this life,
and I'm stuck in these pants
I'm an object in motion
I've lost all emotion
My two legs are broken,
but look at me dance
Look at me dance
An object in motion,
don't ask where I'm going
'Cause where I am going is right
where I am
Oh man!
Don't you like it bigger,
better, but you do what you can?
Where I am going is right
where I am
Right where I am
Don't you like it bigger,
better, but you do what you can?
Where I am going is right
where I am
Oh, inertia
