These are the pictures, these are the feelings from the frontline
Living in silence, feeling the deafness like heavy smoke
Smiling with strangers, counting the days like a spring coiled up inside
Welcome to your future, welcome to your book of lies

Fingers crawl through pages, nothing changes
Living here...

Inertia ' no wish to move at all
Inertia ' everthing's a stone wall
Inertia ' history lets you die

A ragged pile of silent accusers, smell the blood of strangers here
No eyes, no ears, no smell, no taste, the mouth of the maggot is full of this place
Murdered conscience, the pressure is crushing heads, like paper lanterns now
Unbreakable grip, a dead hand driving us forward to the end

Kicking through the traces, a thousand years from now...

Inertia ' no wish to think at all
Inertia ' everthing's a stone wall
Inertia ' history lets you die

Inertia ' no wish to move at all
Inertia ' everthing's a stone wall
Inertia ' history lets you die
