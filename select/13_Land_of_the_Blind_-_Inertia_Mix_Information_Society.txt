Wake up, it's time to stop the dream
The hour has come and things aren't what they seem
We've both grown old on promises and lies
Let's leave behind this fading scheme and push into new skies

Oh, It doesn't mean a thing
In the land of the blind the one-eyed man is king

Stand up, where do you want to go
It's time to chart directions we don't know
Can I find a brand new place to hide?
And push aside this fading sun with both of us inside

Oh, it doesn't mean a thing
In the land of the blind the one-eyed man is king
Oh, I'm better off alone
Where can you go when you cannot go back home?

Oh, it doesn't mean a thing
In the land of the blind the one-eyed man is king
Oh, I'm better off alone
Where can you go when you cannot go back home?
