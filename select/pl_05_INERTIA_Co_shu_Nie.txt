I always knew where I stood
I tried to be so good
Look at me now
I dunno know how but
I'm a real hero
No hiding in the shadows
Time to strut
I'm gonna make a splash
to make this cut
You've got to believe
that I am free
So no hesitation
Picture your planet
in disharmony
Jump into the night
Cuz I can smell the trouble
Don't you miss the fight
Just get there at the double
I gotta make a difference
I'm moving with a purpose
I'm feeling my inertia
Inertia
Inertia
Stubbornly
I will believe I will believe
Keep dreaming
Stubbornly
I will believe I will believe
Keep dreaming
Is it my turn to be the hero?
Yeah!
Cuz I gotta be the hero
Yeah!
Cuz I gotta be the hero
Yeah!
Cuz I gotta be the hero
Yeah!
Didn't you know it's enough
just to deserve that love?
Without a crowd
Without a stage
You're still a real hero
I'm gonna be
the last line of defense
I'll blow it
if I lack the confidence
I've got to believe
that there's a need
for my whole existence
Picture your planet
in disharmony
Jump into the night
Cuz I can smell the trouble
Don't you miss the fight
Just get there at the double
I gotta make a difference
I'm moving with a purpose
I'm feeling my inertia
Inertia
Inertia
Stubbornly
I will believe I will believe
Keep dreaming
Stubbornly
I will believe I will believe
Keep dreaming
Is it my turn to be the hero?
Yeah!
Cuz I gotta be the hero
Yeah!
Cuz I gotta be the hero
Yeah!
Cuz I gotta be the hero
Yeah!
All my life
they said that I was strange
But I knew that
I could be the change
I still ain't done enough
Not even close
Jump into the night
Cuz I can smell the trouble
Don't you miss the fight
Just get there at the double
I gotta make a difference
I'm moving with a purpose
I'm feeling my inertia
Inertia
Inertia
Stubbornly
I will believe I will believe
Keep dreaming
Stubbornly
I will believe I will believe
Keep dreaming
Is it my turn to be the hero?
Yeah!
Cuz I gotta be the hero
Yeah!
Cuz I gotta be the hero
Yeah!
Cuz I gotta be the hero
Yeah!
